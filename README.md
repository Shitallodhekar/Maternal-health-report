**Maternal Abdominal Fat and Pregnancy Outcomes**

Project Overview : 

The Maternal Health project aims to explore the relationship between various maternal health factors, particularly abdominal fat, and pregnancy outcomes. The dataset includes 211 patients, with 116 variables covering demographics, health measurements, 
lab results, and delivery details. We analyzed how factors like body fat, substance use, and pre-existing conditions (such as diabetes and hypertension) impact pregnancy complications, birth weight, delivery methods, and neonatal outcomes.

ðŸ“š Dataset Description
Collected: Oct 2016 â€“ Dec 2017 in a low-risk outpatient clinic Sample Size: 211 patients (from an initial 272) Variables: 116 (demographic, ultrasound, lab, nutrition, delivery outcomes)

Focus:

Maternal visceral and subcutaneous fat (epigastric & periumbilical)
Pregnancy outcomes (e.g., GDM, preeclampsia, birthweight, NICU)
Ultrasound biometry, lab results, and anthropometry
ðŸ› Technologies Used PostgreSQL â€“ for data storage and queries

Power BI â€“ for data visualization

DAX / SQL â€“ for querying and metrics

ðŸ§¼ SQL Data Cleaning
We cleaned missing values, standardized categorical labels, and converted data types using PostgreSQL.

Key Findings:

Visceral Fat and Pregnancy Risks: Increased visceral fat is linked to higher instances of complications like gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and higher birth weight, emphasizing the importance of managing maternal weight.
Substance Use and Body Fat: Women who used substances (alcohol, tobacco, drugs) had higher body fat, correlating with increased risks for complications like hypertension and gestational diabetes.
BMI and Blood Pressure: Higher pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with elevated systolic blood pressure, which can impact both maternal and neonatal health.
Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR): A higher WHR is associated with preterm births and complications like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.
C-section Deliveries: Higher body fat, particularly over 45%, correlates with an increased likelihood of C-sections, highlighting the importance of weight management during pregnancy.
Conclusion The project emphasizes the need for monitoring and managing maternal weight, especially abdominal fat, to reduce risks during pregnancy. It also suggests that lifestyle changes, such as diet adjustments and substance use counseling, can significantly improve maternal and fetal health outcomes.
